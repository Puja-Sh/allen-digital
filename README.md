## Problem Statement

Create a Ul application to randomly draw 5 cards from a deck of 52 cards and display them in a list on Ul.

Deck of cards
A standard 52-card deck comprises 13 ranks in each of the four suits: clubs (8), diamonds (*), hearts (9) and spades (4). Each suit includes three court cards (face cards), King, Queen and Jack. Each suit also includes ten numeral cards or pip cards, from one (Ace) to ten.


- The layout of each card can be very basic, it's suggested that you use emoji (given in above deck of cards description) for shape of each suit.
- Proper alignment and responsive Ul that scales to mobile devices
Functionality
- Clicking on draw card should randomly draw 5 cards from the deck and show it grid view below
When clicking draw card again, it should append new cards to the grid on top.
- Remove card from the deck once its drawn
- Handle case of deck being empty and show appropriate message.
